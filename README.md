<br>
An addition to my **Factory Monitoring Screen** and **Factory Monitoring Expanded** scripts. This one monitors all Transfer Units on the core.
<br>
## Installation
Simply connect core and screen(s) to PB in any order. The script will tell you on start how many screens is needed for your factory in LUA chat.<br>
Current limit is 6 screens and 408 Transfer Units but it can easily be expanded up to 9 screens on demand.
