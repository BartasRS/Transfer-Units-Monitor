<br>
An addition to my [Factory Monitoring Screen](https://github.com/BartasRS/Factory_monitoring_screen) and [Factory Monitoring Expanded](https://github.com/BartasRS/Factory-Monitoring-Expanded) scripts. This one monitors all Transfer Units on the core.
<br>
## Installation
Simply connect core and screen(s) to PB in any order. The script will tell you on start how many screens is needed for your factory in LUA chat.<br>
Current limit is 6 screens and 384 Transfer Units but it can easily be expanded up to 9 screens on demand.
